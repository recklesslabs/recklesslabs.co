# Reckless Labs

The lab was started by [derb](https://twitter.com/wickedderb) and [doob](https://twitter.com/wickeddoob) to tinker and create cool projects. Both of us are extremely curious individuals and love to chat just about anything. So feel free to hit us up!

## [Wicked Craniums](https://wickedcranium.com/)

We discovered the world of NFT collectibles in April 2021 and built a (very passionate) community around the Wicked Craniums collection. Since our launch in June, we have been busy contributing back through various drops, collabs, and novel on-chain innovations like NFT-to-NFT staking.

## Iota

Iota is a web3 shop under Reckless Labs that helps creators tackle the technical challenges that come with launching an NFT collection. From generation of the art, to deployment of a custom smart contract and web3 integration.
